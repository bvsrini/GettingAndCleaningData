## Project Description
The project involves using the data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S Smart phone, working with it and 
prepare a clean data set "Human Activity Recognition Using Smart phones Dataset Version 10" data set collected from  the 
 [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) or 
[Project Data Set] (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) site is studied and a tidy 
data set is worked out for useful analysis The tidy set involves only the data associated with  the mean and standard deviation of 
multiple variables associated  with the data files 
 
##Study design and data processing
The original data  was collected from the Samsung Galaxy phones from 30 volunteers by various experiments 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a 
smart phone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, number of observations were captured  for 
the 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned 
into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data
The "Data Set Information" in the  [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) 
 or the README.txt contains more information

The data set contains following files 

* README.txt
* features_info.txt: Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector
* features.txt: List of all features
* activity_labels.txt: Labels for  the x_train and x_test with their activity name
* train/X_train.txt: Training set
* train/y_train.txt: Training labels
* test/X_test.txt: Test set
* test/y_test.txt: Test labels

The entire data set is partitioned into X_train.txt and X_test.txt The corresponding activity numbers for the observations are in y_train.txt 
and y_test.txt respectively.So the complete data set must be compiled by combining these two data sets The column headers are in features.txt  

The project requires to select only variables that have mean() and std()  There are 66 variables that fit this criteria The tidy data requires 
data aggregated for all the subjects ( ie30) for all activities (i.e. 6) So the final tidy data set is expected to have 6 * 30 = 180 rows  for all 
subjects and activities and  66 variables + subject + activities = 68 columns 

###Collection of the raw data
The following link explains how the original data is collected and pre-processed from the  30 volunteers 
[UCI Machine Learning Repository- Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00240/UCI%20HAR%20Dataset.names)

###Notes on the original (raw) data 
There are total 30 volunteers (or subjects) The train data set contains 70% of the volunteer population and the test data set contains 30%.
So the train data set  contains activities 21 subjects (volunteers) and the test data set contains 9 subjects.  There are 7352 observations on the train
data set and 2947 observations on the test data set.  Out of the total 10299 observations the no of observations for each subject is not equal
as seen below. 
``` {r}
## Here sel_data is the data set containing variables selected for this project
>  as.list(summarize (group_by(sel_data,Subjects),n()))

```
There are multiple rows of observations for the same subjects and activities without any additional information on them that separates them like date and time of 
observation. So in order to prepare a tidy data we need to aggregate them. 

Also the variable names for mean() and std() mentioned within features_info.txt is different than that is provided in features.txt. The incorrect variable 
names need to be cleaned. 

features_info.txt variable names
```
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag
```
features.txt variable names from the data set
```
[64] "fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-std()"   "fBodyBodyGyroMag-mean()"     "fBodyBodyGyroMag-std()"     
[67] "fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-mean()" "fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-std()" 
```
##Creating the tidy datafile
  
###Guide to create the tidy data file
The high level steps to create the tidy data file is as follows:
1. Download the data files from the [Project Data Set] (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
2. Load the following files  into separate data sets (Pls. note we are not loading the files within Inertial Signal directories)
	* features.txt: 
	* activity_labels.txt
	* train/X_train.txt
	* train/y_train.txt
	* train/subject_train.txt
	* test/X_test.txt
	* test/y_test.txt
	* test/subject_test.txt
3. Observe the data in each of the above data sets
4. Combine the test,train observations, subjects,activities (y_train,y_test) data in the same order and attach them into one data set.
5. Add variable names from features.txt to the data set in step (4) as column names
6. Subset the data in step (5) to include only mean() and std() variables.
7. Change the activity numbers to Activity labels using the activity_labels.txt
8. Aggregate the data by Activities,Subjects so we have one value for Activities,Subjects and a variable
9. Replace the Variable names by descriptive variable names. Create the descriptive variable names by reading the Readme.txt and features_info.txt
	
	
###Cleaning of the data
The Readme.md document that describes the code in greater detail. The following are the few cleaning steps that are performed in the code . 
The steps below refer to the "Detail Steps to create the Tidy data file" section in Readme.md
 The above guide gives a great detail on the steps. This section concentrates on specific steps that specify the cleaning activities:
 Step 15 (c) - Retain only the columns containing mean() and std() in their variables. care is taken not to include variables like meanFreq() (sel_data)
 This step uses grep to pick columns that have mean() or std() as part of their name. 
 ```
 sel_col_nm <- grep("*.(mean|std)\\(\\)*",colnames(data))
 sel_data <- data[,sel_col_nm]
 ```
  
 Step 15 (g) - Add a column "Activities" by resolving the activity numbers on "Activities1" to activity labels using act_lab data set from step 2
 This step is accomplished by looking up the activity labels from act_lab dataset based on the Activities number in Activities1 variable. 
 
 ```
 Activities = as.character(act_lab$V2)[sel_data$Activities1]
 ```
 Step 15 (i) -  Replace the column names which are erroneously defined with the correct name. 
 The following code replaces the columns that contains "BodyBody" with "Body" as specified in the section "Notes on Original (Raw) Data"
 ```
 colnames(sel_data) <- sub("BodyBody","Body",colnames(sel_data))
 ```
 Step 16: Clean the observations data by aggregating into subjects and activities as follows:
 The following code melts the columns, aggregates it and converts to wide format. Pls. note that change to Subjects variables is changed to factor 
 for easy manipulation.
 ```
 melt_data <- melt(sel_data,id.vars = c("Subjects","Activities"))
 sel_data <- sel_data %>% mutate(Subjects1 = factor(Subjects)) %>% select (-Subjects) %>% rename(Subjects = Subjects1)
 melt_data <- melt(sel_data,id.vars = c("Subjects","Activities"))
 act_sub_var <- group_by(melt_data, Activities,Subjects,variable)
 sum_data <- summarize(act_sub_var,mean(value))
 tidy_data <- dcast(sum_data, Activities+Subjects ~ variable, value.var = "mean(value)")

 ```
