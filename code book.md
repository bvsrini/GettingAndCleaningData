## Project Description
The project involves using the data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S Smart phone, working with it and 
prepare a clean data set. "Human Activity Recognition Using Smart phones Dataset Version 1.0" data set collected from  the 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones or 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip site is studied and a tidy 
data set is worked out for useful analysis. The tidy set involves only the data associated with  the mean and standard deviation of 
multiple variables associated  with the data files. 
 
##Study design and data processing
 The original data  was collected from the Samsung Galaxy phones from 30 volunteers by various experiments. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 
The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 
 
###Collection of the raw data
Description of how the data was collected.
 
###Notes on the original (raw) data 
Some additional notes (if avaialble, otherwise you can leave this section out).
 
##Creating the tidy datafile
 
###Guide to create the tidy data file
Description on how to create the tidy data file (1. download the data, ...)/
 
###Cleaning of the data
Short, high-level description of what the cleaning script does. [link to the readme document that describes the code in greater detail]()
 
##Description of the variables in the tiny_data.txt file
General description of the file including:
 - Dimensions of the dataset
 - Summary of the data
 - Variables present in the dataset
 
(you can easily use Rcode for this, just load the dataset and provide the information directly form the tidy data file)
 
###Variable 1 (repeat this section for all variables in the dataset)
Short description of what the variable describes.
 
Some information on the variable including:
 - Class of the variable
 - Unique values/levels of the variable
 - Unit of measurement (if no unit of measurement list this as well)
 - In case names follow some schema, describe how entries were constructed (for example time-body-gyroscope-z has 4 levels of descriptors. Describe these 4 levels). 
 
(you can easily use Rcode for this, just load the dataset and provide the information directly form the tidy data file)
 
####Notes on variable 1:
If available, some additional notes on the variable not covered elsewehere. If no notes are present leave this section out.
 
##Sources
Sources you used if any, otherise leave out.
 
##Annex
If you used any code in the codebook that had the echo=FALSE attribute post this here (make sure you set the results parameter to 'hide' as you do not want the results to show again)
